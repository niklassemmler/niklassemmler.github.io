  <p>Hi there! Welcome to my site!</p>
  <p>I recently completed my PhD. The focus of my thesis is on data management issues for the future Industrial Internet of
  Things. If you want to know more, head over to the <a href="#research">research</a>
  section.</p>
  <p>During my PhD  became a member in the <a href="https://softwarecampus.de/en/">Software
    Campus</a>, a German program that supports PhD with a 2-year leadership
  programme. As member of the <a href="http://www.bbdc.berlin/home/">Berlin Big
  Data Center (BBDC)</a> project I studied the performance of Apache Flink for straggling
  tasks. I also organized an introduction to
  programming course with ~800 students.
  Or just Check out my <a href="#cv">CV</a>.</p>

  <!--<p>The focus of my PhD is set on optimizing datacenter resource usage for big data
  analytics. I habe been involved in the Berlin Big Data Center, where I worked
  on establishing network performance guarantees for data analytics jobs of
  Apache Flink. As a participant of the Software Campus programme I worked on
  extending big data analytics to the wide-area.</p>-->
